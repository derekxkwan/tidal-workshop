# MISC

## WHY TIDAL CYCLES?
- pattern strings allow for concise expression of rhythmic ideas
- software stack a bit more transparent than Sonic Pi (and easier to install on Linux)
  - expanding on TidalCycles a bit easier than other alternatives
- can easily complexify simple input

## WHY NOT TIDAL CYCLES?
- not so great for aleatoric/non-cyclic/non-beat music (although actually can get pretty ambient)
- not so great for "non-aligned" music (cycles with diff endpoints)
- maybe not so great for super-"process-based" music?
- scheduling larger formal structural ideas somewhat clunky (verse-chorus, etc)

## GENERAL LIVE CODING THOUGHTS
- a bit different than traditional music performance
  - not responsible for individual note events, level of interactivity with sound isn't one-to-one
  - act less like a traditional performer, more like a conductor/director
  - nevertheless, requires practice (although a diff sort)!
- sometimes just let the environment do the work ("idiomatic")
  - although can lead to "TidalCycles"-sounding music
- live coding can be exploratory
  - but sometimes having a game plan (listening to your "inner ear") is really helpful too
  - can be interplay (so keep ears open)
